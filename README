haproxy.cfg
---
Haproxy listens on port 80. It routes api.gear-list.com to gearlist_api_1:3000,
which is where docker-compose runs the rails-api service. It routes
original.gear-list.com to gearlist_original_1:3000, which is where
docker-compose runs the original all-in-one rails application. It routes
browser-sync.gear-list.com to gearlist_browser_client_1:3001, which is where
docker-compose runs the Browsersync UI application. Lastly, it routes any other
request to gearlist_browser_client_1:3000, which is where docker-compose runs
the static lite-server.

The timeouts in the defaults section are important for ensuring websocket
connectivity between browsers and browsersync. Specifically, the infinite tunnel
timeout allows established websocket connections to persist indefinitely. Never
do that in prod, obvs.
